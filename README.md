# 🤖 AICAD: AI-Generated Content Authenticity Detector

> 🔍 Detect whether content (text, image, video) is generated by humans or artificial intelligence.

---

## 🌐 Overview

As generative AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between human and AI-generated content is a growing challenge. AICAD (AI-Generated Content Authenticity Detector) is a data science project that leverages machine learning to **identify AI-generated vs. human-generated content** across different modalities like **text**, **images**, and eventually **videos**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Detect AI-generated **text content** (e.g., articles, essays, bios)
- 📷 Build a pipeline to flag AI-generated **images** (GANs, memes, faces)
- 🎥 Plan for future **deepfake detection** in videos
- 🧠 Provide explainability and user trust with XAI techniques

## 🧪 Sample Usage

from aicad_text_model import predict_origin
sample = "This article explores the advances of artificial intelligence in healthcare."
result = predict_origin(sample)
print(result)  # Output: 'AI-generated' or 'Human-written'

📊 Sample Results

Sample Text	Prediction
"The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 and is a top tourist attraction."	Human-written
"AI is revolutionizing education through adaptive learning platforms."	AI-generated
